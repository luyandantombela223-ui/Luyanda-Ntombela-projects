Java Projects – Luyanda Ntombela

About
This repository contains my Java programming projects completed as part of my
University of Cape Town coursework and structured practice.

The work focuses on understanding core Java fundamentals, with strong emphasis
on Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation, and basic program design.

All projects reflect my current level as a first-year Computer Science student.

Most Recent Projects (January 2026)

Inheritance, Polymorphism and UML
Files include: Rectangle.java, HLine.java, VLine.java, Box.java, Screen.java, Accessory.java
Additional material: UML PDF diagrams

How it was created:

Implemented multiple related classes to model objects using inheritance

Applied polymorphism through method overriding

Used UML diagrams to plan and understand class relationships

Developed as part of university coursework focusing on OOP design principles

Encapsulation
Files include: ParkingTariff.java, TariffTable.java, TimePeriod.java, CarParkSim.java

How it was created:

Designed classes with private fields and public methods

Focused on protecting internal state using encapsulation

Simulated a parking tariff system using well-structured classes

Built during Java OOP practice at university

Arrays and Inheritance
Files include: Shape.java, Rectangle.java, Circle.java, NumberUtils.java, CowsAndBulls.java

How it was created:

Combined arrays with inheritance-based class hierarchies

Practiced code reuse through base and derived classes

Strengthened understanding of abstract thinking in Java

Developed as part of structured OOP exercises

Other Java Projects

Creating a Basic Class with Constructors and JUnit
Files include: Ticket.java, Register.java, CarParkSim.java, TestOfTime.java

How it was created:

Implemented constructors to initialise objects correctly

Practiced writing test-driven code using JUnit

Built simple simulations to reinforce object creation and behaviour

Creating a Basic Class
Files include: TestSeller.java

How it was created:

Introduced to defining classes, fields, and methods

Focused on understanding object interaction

One of the earlier Java class design exercises

Basic Syntax
Files include: CalculateDuration.java, SumCosts.java

How it was created:

Practiced Java fundamentals such as variables, conditionals, loops, and methods

Focused on writing correct and readable Java syntax

Completed during early Java programming practice

Notes

All projects are written in Java

The repository is organised by topic to clearly show progression

The emphasis is on clarity, correctness, and understanding of fundamentals

These projects represent academic and learning-focused work
